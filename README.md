# Overview
I am analyzing my screentime on my iPhone. This data has no link, but can be found in the settings on any iPhone. This particular data is specific to my phone.
I wanted to know how much time I had been spending on my phone. More specifically which apps I was spending the most time on and analyzing what
my screentime could look like if I cut out specific apps. This data in specific only follows two weeks of data, but these weeks were very typical and so were picked
to represent my average screentime.

# Data Analysis Results
My first question was very basic: how much time am I spending on my phone everyday?
Other questions I had: Which app am I spending the most time on? How much time would I save if I didn't spend so much time on Instagram? 
Which apps would I like to see on my screentime report that are not on there?

Looking at the data, I discovered that I average about 5 hours and 1 minute on my phone everyday and instagram makes up about 2 hours of that number. Therefore,
if I didn't spend time on instagram we can conclude that it would take about 2 hours off of my average screentime. This brings me to a new average of 2 hours and 56 minutes.
I discovered that I spend very little time on productive apps, such as the gospel library app. I would like for this app to show up at the top of my screentime report way more often
than it currently is.


# Development Environment
I used excel and my iPhone to complete this whole project. I did spend a couple of hours in Power BI but it did not go well, so I decided to stick with excel. I really had high hopes, but 
left Power BI with more questions than I came with. I used the tools within excel and online references to get the equations that I needed. You could say I used my own library
because I manually inserted all of the data from my iPhone (apple does not allow you to pull data). I used VBA where I needed to.

# Future Work

* I would love to transfer some of the data over to Power BI sometime to create better visuals and dashboards
* I would love to find a way to pull data weekly and have it update my dashboards
* There is definitely a lot of room for more organization
